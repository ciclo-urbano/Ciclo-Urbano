# Ciclo Urbano


## Project Description

For this project we worked with West Town Bikes, a Chicago area youth-focused nonprofit, to create a digital inventory of bikes for Ciclo Urbano, their brick-and-mortar storefront. Our application allows users to browse in-stock bikes without having to visit the shop in person or call, which were the only previous ways.
